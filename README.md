# NTU 5M Data Entry Test ‚Äì Submission by Farida Charania

This repository contains my completed solutions for the **NTU Advanced Professional Certificate in Data Science & AI** entry test.

## üß† About Me

I am a Singaporean entrepreneur with over 20 years of international leadership experience across banking, executive search, and AI-enabled workforce solutions. I took this challenge as a learning opportunity and completed it despite not coming from a coding background. All solutions were self-taught and developed using Python and tested on Google Colab.

## ‚úÖ Submission Summary

Each task is located in the `/src/` directory and corresponds to the required assessment questions. All functions and classes are written in Python and include basic validation and test cases.

| File      | Task Description                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `q1.py`   | Swap two numeric values                          |
| `q2.py`   | Find and replace values in a list                |
| `q3.py`   | Add a new key-value pair to a dictionary         |
| `q4.py`   | Count the number of words in a sentence          |
| `q5.py`   | Filter even numbers from a list                  |
| `q6.py`   | Extract keys with numeric values from a dictionary |
| `q7.py`   | Define a `Car` class and return a formatted string |

## üß™ How to Run

You can copy each `.py` file into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run them locally using any Python IDE.

Each file contains:
- A function or class as per the task
- Input validation
- A test case with both valid and invalid inputs for clarity

## üôè Note of Gratitude

This challenge helped me bridge theory and practice in coding. I appreciate the opportunity to be considered for this course and look forward to deepening my data science capabilities further.
